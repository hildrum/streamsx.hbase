<p class="p">This file describes how to get started using HBASE and Streams with this toolkit. 
</p>

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://hbase.apache.org/">Apache HBASE</a> is non-relational database modeled  after Google's BigTable. It is highly scalable, but does not have some of the  features that come with a standard relational database. 
</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Getting HBASE</strong> This toolkit requires that HBASE already be installed and running on your system. HBASE, in turn, requires <a class="xref" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">HDFS</a> and <a class="xref" href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">Zookeeper</a>. If you are working from a BigInsights installation, all of these are installed as part of that.  If not, see their documentation for how to download, setup, and install. 
</p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Note: The host on which Streams is installed must be able to communicate with the hosts where HBASE is installed, but you do not need both on the same host.</em>  
</p>

<p class="p">This toolkit was tested against HBASE v0.94, but probably will work against newer versions. 
</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Setup</strong> The toolkit needs certain libraries from HBASE to compile.  At runtime, it needs some IP and port information to connect. 
</p>

<p class="p">For the toolkit to find what it needs, set the environment variable HBASE_HOME to point to the  directory containing HBASE (ie, the directory one step above conf and bin).  You'll likewise need to set HADOOP_HOME to point to the directory containing hadoop.  Again, this is the directory one step up from conf and bin. In BigInsights, it's <tt class="ph tt">IHC</tt>. 
</p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">If streams is not a host containing the HBASE</em> then first copy the entire HBASE_HOME and HADOOP_HOME to a place accessible to streams.  The operators need both the config files from the conf directory and some of the jars under those directories. 
</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Building the toolkit</strong> Once you have set the HBASE_HOME and HADOOP_HOME environment variables, you can build the toolkit by typing ant either in the top-level directory or in the toolkit directory.  If you cloned the repository from github, or downloaded the zip file or archive, then you must do this step, as otherwise there is none of the toolkit artifacts (toolkit.xml, operator xml files, etc) that Streams needs. 
</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Using the toolkit</strong> The <a class="xref" href="com.ibm.streamsx.hbase:overview.spl">com.ibm.streamsx.hbase:overview.spl</a> contains an overall description of the toolkit.  To see the operators in action, look at the samples.  <tt class="ph tt">PutRecord</tt> uses HBASE to store book information, and <tt class="ph tt">PutSample</tt> stores information about characters in a book.  In both cases, you'll need to create the table before running the app, so be sure to read  the comment. 
</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Viewing tuples in HBASE</strong> One very useful tool for debugging is the hbase shell.  To run it, you must be on a HBASE host (ie,  just copying over the files works for streams, but won't work here), and then run <tt class="ph tt">$HBASE_HOME/bin/hbase shell</tt> You'll use the shell to create tables and view their status.
